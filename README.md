1. be run in a chromium browser
2. The database behind the api needs to be active, after 3 days idle it will stop running. To get it up and running again, email: altho18@student.sdu.dk
3. The api needs to be running on localhost or on our webserver. To change which to use, just uncomment the baseurl inside the popup.js and background.js file
